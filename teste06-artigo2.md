| **Concept** | **Explanation** |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Attention Metadata | Data that captures the interactions between users and learning resources, including the time spent, actions taken, and resources accessed. |
| Learning Analytics | The collection, analysis, and interpretation of data about learners and their interactions with learning environments to improve teaching and learning. |
| Learning Dashboards | Visual representations of learner data that provide insights into their progress, engagement, and areas for improvement. |
| Learning Recommenders | Systems that use machine learning algorithms to recommend learning resources and activities to learners based on their past interactions and preferences. |
| Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) | Learner-centric platforms that aggregate and integrate learning resources and tools to support personalized learning experiences. |
| Social Learning | Learning that occurs through interactions with others, such as through online forums, discussion boards, and social media. |
| Visualization | The use of graphical representations to present data in a way that makes it easier to understand and interpret. |
