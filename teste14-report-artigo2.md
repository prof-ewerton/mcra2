|---|---|---|
| Active | Active_Stakeholder | Active stakeholders are those who are actively involved in generating data or directly influencing the learning process. |
| Active Data | Active_Data | Active data refers to data that is constantly changing and being updated, as opposed to static data which is fixed. |
| Adaptive | AdaptiveLearning | Adaptive learning refers to using analytics to personalize the learning experience for individual students, adjusting the learning pathway or content based on their progress and needs. |
| Administrator | Administrator | Administrators are those managing the educational institution or program. |
| Context | Context | Context refers to the environment where educational activities occur. This can be either a physical environment (like a classroom) or a digital environment (like a learning management system). |
| Course | Course | Course refers to a structured program of learning, typically offered within an educational institution. It represents a unit of study with defined learning objectives, content, and assessments. |
| Data | Data | Data refers to the information generated by the activities of stakeholders (students, teachers, etc.) within a specific learning environment. |
| Developer | Developer | Developers are those creating and maintaining the technology used for learning analytics. |
| Digital | Digital | Digital refers to a learning management system (LMS), online forums, virtual reality learning spaces, or any digital platform used for teaching and learning. |
| Dynamic | Dynamic | Dynamic data refers to data that changes over time. It's the opposite of static data. |
| Environment | Environment | Environment refers to the setting or context in which learning and teaching take place. This can encompass both physical and digital spaces. |
| Gamification | Gamification | Gamification refers to using game-like elements in learning to make it more engaging and motivating. |
| Government | Government | Governors are individuals or groups involved in setting the overarching policies and direction of education. |
| Hybrid | Hybrid | Hybrid environment refers to a learning setting that combines both physical and digital spaces. |
| Instrument | Instrument | Instrument refers to any tool or method used to collect data on learning activities. |
| Learning_Analytics | Learning_Analytics | Learning analytics is an area of research and practice that uses computational analysis of learning process data to better understand and improve learning. |
| Method | Method | Method refers to the approach or procedure used to conduct the research and build the ontology of learning analytics. |
| Objective | Objective | Objective refers to the intended goals or aims of using learning analytics. |
| Outcome | Outcome | Outcome refers to the result or consequence of a learning activity or intervention. |
| Passive | Passive_Stakeholder | Passive stakeholders are those who are not actively involved in generating data or directly influencing the learning process. |
| Physical | Physical | Physical refers to a traditional classroom, a laboratory, or any physical space where learning activities occur. |
| Predictive | Predictive | Predictive analytics refers to utilizing analytics to forecast future outcomes, such as predicting student success or identifying students at risk of falling behind. |
| Recommendation | Recommendation | Recommendation refers to using analytics to provide personalized recommendations to students or teachers. |
| Reflective | Reflective | Reflective analytics refers to employing analytics to help students and teachers reflect on their learning and teaching processes. |
| Researcher | Researcher | Researchers are individuals studying the effectiveness of learning and teaching practices. |
| Route | Route | Route refers to the path or sequence a learner takes through the learning materials or activities within a course or learning environment. |
| Stakeholder | Stakeholder | Stakeholder refers to any individual or group that has an interest in or is affected by the learning process. |
| Static | Static | Static data refers to data that doesn't change frequently or at all during a specific timeframe of analysis. |
| Student | Student | Students are individuals providing additional support and guidance to learners. |
| Teacher | Teacher | Teachers are those responsible for designing and delivering instruction. |
| Technique | Technique | Technique refers to the specific tools and procedures used within the broader methods to achieve particular aspects of the research. |
| Technology | Technology | Technology refers broadly to the tools and systems used to support learning and the collection and analysis of data related to learning. |
| Way | Way | Way is a general term and its meaning depends entirely on its context within a sentence. It usually refers to a method, approach, or process. |
