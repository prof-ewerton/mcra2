**Multimodal Learning Analytics**

Multimodal learning analytics is a field of research that focuses on the analysis of data from multiple sources to understand how students learn. This data can include data from sensors, such as eye-tracking and motion-tracking, as well as data from educational software, such as learning management systems and online quizzes.

**Programming Modes**

Programming modes are different ways of programming that can be used to create different types of applications. The two main programming modes are **text-based programming** and **graphical programming**. Text-based programming involves writing code in a text editor, while graphical programming involves using a graphical user interface to create programs.


**Programming Styles**
Programming styles are different ways of writing code that can be used to achieve the same result. There are many different programming styles, and each style has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common programming styles include **structured programming**, **object-oriented programming**, and **functional programming**.


**Text Mining**

Text mining is a field of research that focuses on the analysis of text data. This data can include text from documents, emails, and social media posts. Text mining can be used to identify patterns and trends in text data, and to extract information from text data.


**Construction Competence**

Construction competence is the ability to understand and apply the principles of construction. This competence includes the ability to read and interpret construction drawings, to understand the properties of different building materials, and to safely and efficiently construct buildings.


**Object/Body Tracking**

Object/body tracking is a field of research that focuses on the tracking of objects and bodies in video data. This data can be used to understand the movement of objects and bodies, and to identify objects and bodies in video data.
