# Multimodal Learning Analytics

| Concept | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Multimodal Learning Analytics | New high-frequency data collection technologies and machine learning analysis techniques could offer new insights into learning, especially in tasks in which students have ample space to generate unique, personalized artifacts, such as a computer program, a robot, or a solution to an engineering challenge. |
| Unscripted, constructionist, complex tasks | The incorporation of multimodal techniques, which are extensively used in the multimodal interaction community, would allow researchers to examine unscripted, constructionist, complex tasks in more holistic ways. |
| Clustering participants | In particular, as a proof-of-concept, I focused on clustering participants in terms of multiple features of their actions and matching those clusters to the previously known expertise levels. |
| Patterns in students’ programming | First, I showed how the analysis of hundreds of programming snapshots could reveal patterns in students’ programming such as ‘tinkerers’ vs. ‘planners’. |
| Learners’ affect and identity towards engineering | I then showed how even simple word counting and n-gram analysis techniques can reveal learners’ affect and identity towards engineering, and how behavioral traces such as confidence, as well as disfluencies or pauses, can predict a subject’s level of expertise. |
| Clustering of students’ actions | Using video analysis, I showed how the clustering of students’ actions during a construction task, paired with human labeling, could also be a predictor of learning. |
| Hand coordination | Finally, I explored hand coordination as a possibly meaningful metric. |
| Naturalistic assessments | The goal of the paper is to be a proof of concept of novel assessment techniques along several modes. In all studies, I was interested in the definition of expertise and in the categorization of learners based purely on their behavior, actions, or utterances—not on the assumed level of their knowledge or their performance on extraneous tests. |
| Social, ecologically valid, more inclusive | Many of these studies are preliminary; further studies should get deeper into the nuances of expertise, which was oversimplified for the purposes of this paper. Even with these simplifications, I was able to show that important aspects of learning “hide in the details,” and both overt and tacit elements could be indicative to determine students’ knowledge. The implication of this work is that, ultimately, multimodal learning analytics could be used to devise naturalistic assessments which would be, at the same time, social, ecologically valid, more inclusive as to the types of knowledge they measure, and enabling real-time evaluation in realistic tasks, either off or online. |
