# LIST OF CONCEPTS AND CONTEXT OF THE PAPER
## TITLE: Learning Analytics for Visualization and Recommendation
| Concept | Context |
|---|---|
| Attention | Attention is a core concern in learning: as learning resources become available in more and more abundant ways, attention becomes the scarce factor, both on the side of learners as well as on the side of teachers. |
| Learning Analytics | The new field of learning analytics is quite related to similar evolutions in other domains, such as Big Data [1], e-science [14, 9, 26], web analytics [7], educational data mining [25]. |
| Visualization | Many of these inspiring applications take a visual approach. Yet, if visualizations are to have any effect beyond the initial ”wow” factor, it would be useful to have more clarity on what the intended goal is and how to assess whether that goal is achieved. |
| Recommendation | By collecting data about user behavior, learning analytics can also be mined for recommendations, of resources, activities or people [17]. |
| Data Based Research on Learning | On a meta-level, learning analytics provides exciting opportunities to ground research on learning in data and to transform it from what is currently all too often a collection of opinions and impossible-to-falsify conceptualizations and theories [23]. |
